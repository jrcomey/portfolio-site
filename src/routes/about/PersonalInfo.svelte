            <h1>A Little More Background</h1>
            <p>I grew up in California's southern Bay Area.</p>
            <p>I've always had a passion for spaceflight. Like many engineers, I grew up watching the Space Shuttle launches, and always wanted to work on spacecraft like that. It had always seemed like a pipe dream, but the longer I worked, the more practical of an option it became. I've now graduated with two B.S.'s in engineering, and started my career over two years ago with Lockheed Martin Space.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I like to hike in many of the fantastic national and state parks the California has to offer, often as part of a nature photography trip. You may see some of my work scattered around the background of this website, and if you see something that you'd like to visit yourself, <a href="mailto:jack.rhys.comey@gmail.com">please don't hesitate to reach out.</a></p>
