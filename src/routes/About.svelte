        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> 
                My name is Jack Comey, and I'm a Guidance, Navigation, and Control Engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area, working in the space domain. I graduated from UC Davis in 2021, with double Bachelors degrees in Mechanical Engineering, and Aerospace Engineering, and have since worked for Lockheed Martin Space in Sunnyvale.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                I used the Covid-19 pandemic as an opportunity to improve my academic work and made the Dean's List three times during lockdown. I used the extra time available to take my work to the next level, and my team won the NASA ARMD Aeronautics competition as a part of the result of that.
                Since graduating, I've been at Lockheed Martin Space in Sunnyvale, working on precision motor controls for launch vehicle attitude control systems.
            </p> -->
            
            <!-- <p>
                In 2019, I lead an aircraft design team that competed in SAE Aero Design West, a heavy-lift aircraft design competition that competed last May against teams from a wide variety of nations. 
                Being a part of this team has provided invaluable hands-on design and leadership experience that doesn't typically come from a classroom setting. 
                Unlike many of our competitors, our team has a modest budget and limited personnel, and we've had to find creative ways to overcome our challenges. 
                As a result, Iâ€™ve had experience fulfilling ambitious engineering goals in short design cycles, using limited resources and innovative designs both as a design lead, and as an administrative lead for my team.
            </p> -->

            <!-- <p>
                I have years of experience with MATLAB and Python, especially with close-to-the-wire controls design and testing. I've delivered flight code to customers,
                I'm adept with multiple programming languages, such as Matlab, C, and Python, and I have strong communication and interpersonal skills.
            </p> -->

          <p>
              I have a deep passion for civil and commercial spaceflight, and believe it will continue to provide a common benefit for mankind.
