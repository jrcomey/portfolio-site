    Across the nation, seperated from meeting by geography, by workfore, by culture, and ideology, there is a happy marriage to be had. 
    Neither yet know it. Occasionally flirting, they have interacted without being introduced. Those who know both only tangentially are 
    surprised to find that they are not only not a couple, but in fact are total strangers. 
</p>

<p>
    The future happy couple in question are the aerospace and tech industries. Where tech deploys rapid change in yearly generations, aerospace delivers incremental change more in line with the generation of her workforce.
    Where aerospace designs products so resilient the original crew's grandchildren will fly them, the tech industry suffers from rapid decay and chokes under planned obselencense.
    Where tech is free and open, aerospace is closed off and jealously guarded. 
</p>

<p>
    In so many words: aerospace is strong where tech is weak, and weak where tech is strong. What the practices of the aerospace industry bring to the table in terms of hardware, the tech industry brings in software.
    What we have is simply a matter of Hegelian dialectics: one must absorb the other, and in the process of doing so, become something wholly new.
