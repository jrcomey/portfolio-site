            <h3>Weather Tolerant Controls Scheme for High Wind Environments</h3>
            <p>
                As part of my undergraduate design project, I worked with my team to develop a system for the Blizzard eVTOL UAM aircraft to withstand both significant gusts and other wind fields common to the Chicago area. I developed a fully fledged Guidance, Navigation, and Control system (GNC), using multiple controllers, to operate the aircraft during flight. I developed optimal controllers using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) from a linearized model, and demonstrated the controller using my UAV simulation. I performed dozens of simulation tests to verify flight performance under windy conditions.

            <h3>Weather Tolerant Urban Air Mobility Concept</h3>
            <p>
                As part of a team of 5, my team and I are developing a weather tolerant, hydrogen powered Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicle, designed for operation in Chicago's cold-weather environment. I developed a fully functional Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) system to enable autonomous flight for the aircraft. I also developed significant parts of the propulsion train for the aircraft, developing propellers using Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory. I also created a flight model for the aircraft and proved the viability of the control method using a Monte Carlo simulation. I additionally designed the propeller for the aircraft, and performed center of mass calculations.
